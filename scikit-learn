To complete the software part of the project in 2 days, we need to focus on the most critical and achievable steps. Since you're on a tight deadline, we will break down the process into efficient tasks that can be realistically done within this time frame.

Day 1: Eye Detection and Preprocessing

1. Set Up Your Development Environment

Time: 1 hour

Install Python and VS Code (if not already done).

Install the required libraries:

pip install opencv-python dlib numpy imutils face_recognition



2. Collect Eye Images for Training

Time: 1-2 hours

Each team member should gather images of their eyes, simulating the niqabi scenario.

Ensure to capture multiple clear images of their eyes from different angles and lighting.



3. Basic Eye Detection using OpenCV/Dlib

Time: 3-4 hours

Task: Detect the eyes using Haar Cascades or Dlib face detection.

Implement Code:

Use the webcam to detect faces.

Use Dlib to find landmarks on the face (especially eyes).

Crop the eye region from the image.


Hereâ€™s the simple code to get started with detecting and cropping the eyes:

import cv2
import dlib

# Load Dlib's face detector and facial landmarks predictor
detector = dlib.get_frontal_face_detector()
predictor = dlib.shape_predictor('shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat')

# Open video capture
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

    # Detect faces
    faces = detector(gray)

    for face in faces:
        landmarks = predictor(gray, face)

        # Extract and draw the eye regions (landmarks 36-41 for left eye, 42-47 for right eye)
        for i in range(36, 42):
            cv2.circle(frame, (landmarks.part(i).x, landmarks.part(i).y), 2, (0, 255, 0), -1)
        for i in range(42, 48):
            cv2.circle(frame, (landmarks.part(i).x, landmarks.part(i).y), 2, (0, 255, 0), -1)

    cv2.imshow('Eye Recognition', frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Goal: Capture and crop the eye regions from the image for further processing.



4. Preprocessing Eye Images

Time: 2-3 hours

Convert the eye images to grayscale.

Resize the images to a consistent size.

Normalize the pixel values.

Day 2: Training and Real-Time Eye Recognition

5. Train a Simple Eye Recognition Model

Time: 3-4 hours

Preprocess the images for the model.

Train a basic K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) or SVM classifier using the eye images.

Steps:

Extract features from the eye regions (e.g., distance between landmarks, contours).

Split the dataset into training and testing data.

Train a KNN/SVM classifier.


Example KNN code:

from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
import numpy as np

# Example: eye features and labels
X = np.array(eye_features)  # Features extracted from images
y = np.array(labels)        # Labels for each image (user names or IDs)

# Train the KNN classifier
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
model.fit(X, y)

# Test with new data (real-time recognition)
predictions = model.predict(new_eye_data)



6. Implement Real-Time Eye Recognition

Time: 2-3 hours

Once the model is trained, integrate it into the real-time video feed from the webcam.

Use the model to recognize eyes in real-time and check if they match the enrolled data (for authentication or identification).

Display the recognition result (e.g., "User recognized" or "User not found").



7. Testing and Debugging

Time: 1-2 hours

Test the real-time system by checking if the model can recognize eyes accurately in different conditions.

Debug any issues such as mismatched data, slow processing, or false negatives.

End of Day 2: Final Integration and GitHub Push

Time: 1 hour

Organize your code, write comments, and ensure everything is working as expected.

Create a GitHub repository and upload the code.


Steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.


2. Initialize a local Git repository (git init).


3. Add the files (git add .).


4. Commit changes (git commit -m "Initial commit").


5. Push to GitHub (git push -u origin main).

Final Note: Since you're working under a tight deadline, focus on getting the core parts (detection, training, real-time recognition) working smoothly. You can always improve the model or add extra features later.
